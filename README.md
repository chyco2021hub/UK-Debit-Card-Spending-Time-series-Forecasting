# UK-Debit-Card-Spending-Time-series-Forecasting
This project analyses and forecasts debit card sspending patterns using time series analysis and forecasting models. The study incorporated macroeconomic variables (interest rates, inflation rates and unemployment rates) and demographic factors (age groups) to build predicitive models for future spending trends).

## Business Objective
To develop accurate forecasting models that can help financial institutions, retailers, and policymakers understand and predict debit card spending behavior under various economic conditions.

## Key Findings
Correlation Insights
Strong positive correlation among age group spending patterns

Moderate relationships between spending and macroeconomic factors

Online spending shows distinct seasonal patterns

## Model Performance
Best Univariate Model: ARIMA (lowest RMSE/MAE)

Best Exogenous Model: VAR with macroeconomic variables

Most Flexible: Prophet with custom seasonality

Business Insights
Age group 35-54 shows highest spending levels

Interest rates have significant inverse relationship with spending

Online spending continues growth trajectory despite economic fluctuations
